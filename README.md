### ğŸ™ƒ about the username
you're probably asking why my username is chunky-milk lol. it all started when i saw an ad on television with chunky milk in it. this was the first television ad i'd ever taken account of (because i never watch tv lol); therefore when i set up user accounts on the internet that's the first thing that came to mind.
