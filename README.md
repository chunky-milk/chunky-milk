### Hello,
my name's chunkymilk0309. i enjoy programming when i have free time as well as experimenting with the Raspberry Pi. i find my Pi an interesting computing device to tinker with as well as use as a desktop machine. 
i live in an undisclosed location as a Linux enthusiast among a large community.

***So, you might ask, what's this website for?***
This is my main GitHub website. It may serve as a "code blog," or maybe it'll just stay this way forever. I haven't decided yet.

I suggest you check out a few of my repositories. Some of them are in active development such as anonsurf for ARM linux devices and Stacer for the raspberry pi. If you do, please consider leaving a star or follow me if you find them helpful :)
